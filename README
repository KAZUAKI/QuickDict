This dictinary app is using iOS5 built-in dictionary. (English-Japanese/English-English)
I'd been using this for myself and it's handy. So I decided to share this.

According to Apple developer's class reference for UIReferenceLibraryViewController, it can not be used for standalone app.

I used the following modules. Thanks Ben!

As for popover effect, I used the following. Thanks Matt!

Also I needed to make the following module by myself. Because UIReferenceLibraryViewController detect device language and I could not show English-English dictionary. So this module overrides the language.

This has not been finished project. So there are some problems.
